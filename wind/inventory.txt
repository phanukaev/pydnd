Armor Glamoured Studded Leather
    Grants an AC of 12 + Dexterity Modifier.
    Can use my bonus action to speak its command word.
    The armor assumes the appearance of a normal set of clothing.
    I may decide what it looks like, inclding color, style and accesories.
    The armor retains its normal bulk and weight.

AC 12 + DexMod
# Does not grant the +1 to AC that usual Glamoured Studded Leather would
# But bumped down a rarity level and thus almost 1k gp in price
# Thanks, Jonas :)

Item Entertainer's Pack
    Contains the following items:
    Backpack,
    Bedroll,
    2 Costumes,
    5 Candles,
    Waterskin,
    Disguise Kit

Item Alchemy Jug
    This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid
    and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty.
    Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken,
    even if the jug is empty.
    You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below
    to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid.
    Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out,
    up to 2 gallons per minute.
    The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.
    Once the jug starts producing a liquid,
    it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum,
    until the next dawn.

Item Focuses for Clairvoyance
    A miniature spy glass and a seashell set with glass pearls.
    Can be used as focuses to cast the Clairvoyance spell.
    Each item is worth 100gp.

Item  The Honking Handkerchief
    Traded this from the Hag in Lorlyn.
    She says its only property is making funny noises when used to blow ones nose,
    but it is also enchanted to not be easily identifiable.
    Who knows what else it does?

Item  Corroded Ruby from Corni's shop
    I took this from Corni's shop when we looked through it.
    Just like all other things inside, it appears to be covered in
    a layer of rust, or rot.
    I should find out what exactly happened to it.

Item Troll's skeletal finger
    Took this from the Troll's skeleton in the swamp by Muriron.
    Pipo claims not to know anything about it, even though he was the 
    only survivor of most recent supposed ``encounter'' with the Troll.
    When we found the troll it was entirely decomposed,
    so if the decomposition was natural,
    it should have been dead when Pipo and the others encountered it.

Equip Ring of Water Walking
    While wearing this ring, 
    you can stand on and move across any liquid surface
    as if it were solid ground.

Equip Eyes of Minute Seeing
    These crystal lenses fit over the eyes.
    While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot.
    You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.

Investigation advantage
