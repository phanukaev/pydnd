Item Goat of Travail
    The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours.
    Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

Item Goat of Travelling
    The goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse.
    It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge.
    While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish.
    When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.

Item Goat of Terror
    The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours.
    The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons.
    One horn becomes a lance, +1, and the other becomes a longsword, +2.
    Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form.
    In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it.
    Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form.
    The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours.
    Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.
