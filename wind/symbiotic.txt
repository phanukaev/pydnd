Feature Sustained Symbiosis
  When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to expend one of your Hit Dice to roll it and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially turning the failure into a success.
  If it uses this feature on a death saving throw, you succeed on the save and regain 1 hit point regardless of the number rolled on the d20.
  Once you succeed on a saving throw due to this trait, the symbiote canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.
